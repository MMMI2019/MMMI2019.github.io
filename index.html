  <h2>Update</h2>
  <p>We are offering multiple <strong>Best Paper Awards</strong> and <strong>Student Paper Awards</strong>, thanks to the support from our sponsors!<br />
  Because of this, submission deadline has been extended to <strong>August 7th</strong>.  </p>
  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>In the field of medical imaging, use of more than one modality (i.e. multimodal ) or more than one scale on the same target has become a growing field as more advanced techniques and devices have become available. For example, simultaneous acquisition of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) has become a standard clinical practice for a number of applications. Another example is the increasing interest in clinical diagnosis that combines high-resolution, localized pathological images and radiological images which captures disease at more global scale. Various analyses using multimodal  medical imaging and computer-aided detection systems have been developed, with the premise that additional modalities can encompass abundant information which is different and complementary to each other. While methods and tools on multiscale image analysis are not widely developed and used. Facing the growing amount of data available from multiscale multimodal  medical imaging facilities and a variety new methods for the image analysis developed so far, this MICCAI workshop aims to move forward the state of the art in multiscale multimodal medical imaging, including both algorithm development, implementation of methodology, and experimental studies. The workshop also aims to facilitate more interactions between researchers in the field of medical image analysis and the field of machine learning, especially in data fusion and multi-source learning.</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>MMMI aim to tackle the important challenge of dealing with medical images acquired from multiscale and multimodal imaging devices, which has been increasingly applied in research studies and clinical practice. This workshop offers an opportunity to present novel techniques and insights of multiscale multimodal  medical images analysis, as well as empirical studies involving the application of multiscale multimodal imaging for clinical use.</p>
  <h2>Topics</h2>
  Topic of submissions to the workshop include, but not limited to: <br />
  <li>Image segmentation techniques based on multiscale multimodal images</li>
  <li>Novel techniques in multiscale multimodal image acquisition</li>
  <li>Registration methods across multiscale multimodal images</li>
  <li>Fusion of images from multiple resolutions and novel visualization methods</li>
  <li>Spatial-temporal analysis using multiple modalities</li>
  <li>Fusion of image sources with different fidelities: e.g. co-analysis of EEG and fMRI</li>
  <li>Multiscale multimodal disease classification and prediction using supervised or unsupervised methods </li>
  <li>Atlas-based methods on multiple imaging modalities</li>
  <li>Cross-modality image generative methods: e.g. generation of synthetic images between CT and MR</li>
  <li>Novel radiomics methods based on multiscale multimodal imaging</li>
  <li>Shape analysis on images from multiple sources and/or multiple resolution</li>
  <li>Graph methods in medical image analysis</li>
  <li>Benchmark studies for multiscale multimodal image analysis: e.g. using electrophysiological signals for validation of fMRI data</li>

  <h2>Submission</h2>
  <h4><strong>Proceedings:</strong></h4>
  <li>The MMMI 2019 proceedings will be published as a volume in the Springer <strong>Lecture Notes in Computer </strong><strong>Science</strong> (LNCS) series.</li>
  <h4><strong>Paper Formatting:</strong></h4>
  <li>Papers are limited to <strong>8 pages</strong>. Papers should be formatted in Lecture Notes in Computer Science style. Style files can be found on the <strong>Springer website</strong>. The file format for submissions is Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). Other formats will not be accepted.</li>
  <li>Authors should consult Springer <a href="ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/svproc/guidelines/Springer_Guidelines_for_Authors_of_Proceedings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authors guidelines</a> and use their proceedings templates, either for <a href="ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/llncs2e.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaTeX</a> or for <a href="ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/word/splnproc1703.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Word</a>, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their <a href="https://goo.gl/hbsa4D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ORCID</a> identifier in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.</li>
  <h4><strong>Blind Review:</strong></h4>
  <li>Reviewing is <u>strictly double blind</u>: authors do not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Please see the <strong>anonymity guidelines</strong> of MICCAI 2019 for detailed explanations of how to ensure this.</li>
  <h4><strong>Submission:</strong></h4>
  <li>MMMI is using an online submission system: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMMI2019">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMMI2019</a></li>
  <h4><strong>Supplemental Material</strong></h4>
  <li>Supplemental material submission is optional. This material may include: videos of results that cannot be included in the main paper, anonymized related submissions to other conferences and journals, and appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential for understanding of the paper. Contents of the supplemental material should be referred to appropriately in the paper and that reviewers are not obliged to look at it.</li>
  <h4><strong>Simultaneous Submission</strong></h4>
  <li>Our policy is that in submitting a paper, authors implicitly acknowledge that NO paper of substantially similar content has been or will be submitted to another conference or workshop until MLMI decisions are made.</li>
